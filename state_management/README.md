# state_management

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Riverpod
### How it works:
    A modern, robust state management library inspired by Provider but with improved safety, testability, and flexibility. State is managed outside the widget tree, making it easier to test and reuse.
    Use case:
    Any app size, especially when you want scalability, modularity, and testability.

### Advantages:
    Dependency injection is super easy with riverpod.
    Compile time safety (less runtime errors).
    Supports async state, parameterized providers, and more.
    riverpod also helps preventing clustered codes.
